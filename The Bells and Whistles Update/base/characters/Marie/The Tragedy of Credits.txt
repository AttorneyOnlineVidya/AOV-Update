Bland and beige, blustering and bitter. Brainlets boast her brand - but better babes be. 
Yukiko is not best girl.

Dim and denied daintiness, dressed dreadfully and drained discernment. Dumbasses draw delighted, definitely dumb.
Chie is not best girl.

Shallow, slutty, simple and selective. Slurping upon senpai she seems set. Simple-minded say she sits squarely as shining selection.
Rise is not best girl.

Criminally characterized, cast comedic contrary to her career. Calling chick-cop choice? Crap.
Naoto is not best girl.

Then, the thot that then trots thighs in tights - though that's the total tract that they tender. Tiring, truly, that they tend to try to tally tall.
Margaret is not best girl.

Lolis? Lecher, lost and low. Lusting longly at little lassie lets long lockup, loser.
Nanako is not best girl.

But at least they're not Marie.
