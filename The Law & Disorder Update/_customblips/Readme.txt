-50db is the lowest option
-25db is the 2nd lowest option.
-10db is slightly lower than Default.
-5 db is the loudest option outside of Default.
Default is a backup, in case you want the old one back.

For those who didn't know what turning down decibel(db) meant.


To install either option, extract the basefolder into your clientfolder.

To note: 
-25 and -50 may be extremely low.
It's not recommended to extract and override while having your client open, or at least while in a room where people are midtalk.
