The strange behavior started as soon as they left the restaurant. More specifically, it started once they were alone, when Susato’s father had left them to their own devices and returned to Susato’s house. Susato had moved to follow him, to change out of the get-up she’d had to wear in court that day, but Rei grabbed her arm and gave her such a worried look that Susato didn’t want to leave her.

“I’ll return later on, Father,” Susato had said, and thankfully, he didn’t question her.

From then on, Rei only got stranger. As they made their way to Rei’s house, Rei was clinging to Susato almost desperately. Susato wondered if she was perhaps fully considering the danger of the situation she had just been in, after her celebratory dinner was over and the air around her had settled. Susato had discussed the case a bit, but Rei seemed disinterested in the subject. Perhaps it was too sensitive for Rei to hear so soon, Susato realized—after all, she had seen a woman die in front of her, and was then accused of committing the crime—so Susato switched topics. She began to talk about her father, about their studies, about mutual friends...and they all got the same response: silence, or a timid face hidden behind a sleeve.

 
Between the lingering adrenaline from the trial, her odd state of dress, and Rei’s behavior, Susato was feeling quite out of place. She felt something like anticipation, perhaps akin to what she felt before entering the courtroom that day, but less dreadful. Even as they sat in Rei’s room, with Rei preparing tea in the evening light, Susato still felt ill at ease, despite the situation being very familiar to her. Perhaps it was Rei’s reserved expression as she poured that made Susato feel anxious...

 

Or, perhaps it was Susato that was causing the reserved expression.

 

Susato made a few more attempts at conversation over tea, but received the same responses. She found it rude, of course, to leave her tea unfinished...but after her cup was empty, she stood, then gave Rei a bow.

 

“Rei...it’s been a trying day,” she began. “I’m guessing you would like some time to rest, now that it’s all said and done. That being said, I’ll leave you to it.”

 

“O-oh...yes, it has been a long day. You probably want to rest too, don’t you, Susato?”

 

Rei smiled as she spoke, but Susato could still sense some trepidation from the both of them. Susato probably just needed some time alone, Susato concluded. Maybe looking at Susato was making her relive that awful trial all over again. “I’m sure everyone involved could use some down-time after that,” Susato agreed. Rei was staring quite intently at her cup of tea. She hadn’t had more than a few sips; not typical of her, Susato noted. “I’ll see you tomorrow, then, Rei—and I hope you feel better.”

 

Despite the strange knot in her chest, Susato forced herself to turn to the door of Rei’s room, to make her way home and fret about Rei from the loneliness of her own room. However, she hadn’t taken a single step past the doors before she heard a commotion from behind her, the clatter of a teapot and the dull sound of a leg hitting the tea table. Susato had barely turned around before Rei was embracing her again, just like she had when Susato had tried to part ways with her earlier in the evening—no, she was even more forward, now. Rather than only holding on to Susato’s arm, she had the entirety of her best friend’s body in her grasp, and she didn’t seem to have any plans of letting go. Instinctively, Susato wrapped her arms around Rei in turn.

 

“Actually,” Rei blurted out, into the sleeve of Susato’s gakuran. Susato waited for Rei to finish. It took a few moments of silence for Rei to mumble, “Actually, Susato, I want you to stay...”

 

Susato smiled to herself, thinking about her friend's fickle nature fondly. Rei had a tendency to let her mind race, and Susato had always found it charming. "Would you like to spend me the night, then?"

 

"I'd like you to, if...if you still want to, after what I say next," Rei said. She hadn't yet left Susato's embrace, but she stiffened in it. Susato wondered what Rei could possibly have said that would make her want to leave. Before the question could leave her lips, though, Rei spoke first. "I realized something today, during the trial. I-I was thinking about it a lot, ever since we left the courthouse. I realized just how much you mean to me, Susato! The thought of being locked away, never seeing you again...that's what gave me the strength to tell the truth."

 

Those words were so simple, so honest and straightforward. So, why did words like that make Susato's heart race? Susato gathered herself, then responded, “Thank you, Rei. But...you’re the one who gave me the strength to defend you in the first place.”

 

Rei shook her head, smiling—less timidly than before, Susato noted. “That’s not the point, though, Susato. What I really wanted to say was that...I really love you, Susato. And you may not feel the same way as I do, but today, you showed me that you love me too—and I can’t thank you enough for that. S-so, thank you!”

 

Susato hadn’t meant to show her surprise on her face. She didn’t realize how her jaw had dropped, how her eyes had widened, until Rei averted her gaze out of what seemed like fear. Susato quickly checked herself, straightened out, and tried to collect her thoughts. What did she really feel about Rei? What was the difference between Rei’s love and Susato’s, if there was a difference? What did Susato want to say next?

 

As it turned out, those questions weren’t hard to answer at all.

 

“Rei...could you look at me?” Rei was still looking off past Susato’s shoulder, and Susato might have seen the beginning of tears in her eyes. Susato took a deep breath, then cupped Rei’s cheek in her hand, and gently turned her head so that they were looking into each other’s eyes. Susato watched a flush wash over Rei’s cheeks, and in the flickering light of the lantern sitting in the corner, Susato didn’t think there was anything more beautiful on the planet. “These feelings are hard to figure out, aren’t they? But...the first thing that comes to mind is that I don’t want to leave you.”

 

“Good!” Rei responded quickly, and Susato couldn’t help the laugh that slipped out. “I don’t want you to leave, Susato! I want...I-I think I want...”

 

After Rei had floundered for a bit, suddenly shy again, Susato decided to take the first step. “Could I kiss you, then, Rei?”

 

“O-oh goodness, Susato...” Susato briefly wondered if she’d overstepped, if she’d moved too fast, but Rei’s response seemed to convey the opposite. “Seeing you look so dashing like this is...it’s almost too much to bear.”

 

Perhaps that explained the blush, then. Susato was completely taken with Rei, and didn’t wait for a more concrete response. She moved slowly, though, giving Rei plenty of time to move away, but she didn’t. In fact, Rei moved in closer, and their lips met in the middle. 

 

Rei’s bashfulness had faded by then, but Susato was still more than happy to take the lead. She cradled the back of Rei’s head with one hand, tilted her head to try a different angle. Rei’s lips parted so slowly, so passively—Susato didn’t know what to do at first, as this was her first kiss, but the soft sound Rei made into her mouth when her tongue moved was enough to make her keep moving. There was the faintest taste of tea, there, but something else beneath it. Was that the taste of Rei, then...?

 

It was nice. The scent of Rei in close proximity and the sound of her surprised squeaks when Susato’s lips moved against hers—those were nice too. Rei was so warm, and Susato loved the feeling of the two of them being pressed together like that. 

 

However, although Susato was compelled to pull Rei closer, Rei moved back, breaking their kiss. “Sorry. Was I a little too eager?”

 

“Not at all! I’ve always liked how curious you can be, Susato,” Rei praised. “It’s just that...well, there are other things I’d like to do, too. M-maybe it’d be more comfortable if we got in my futon?”

 

“Oh! Well, I...” Susato cleared her throat, then tried (and failed) to clear her mind. “We don’t have to if you don't want to."

 

"But I do," Rei said. She pulled back some more, just enough to take Susato's hand. "So, can we? Please?”

 

“Hm...you did a rather good job in court today,” Susato said, and the statement was genuine despite the teasing undertone. “I suppose you’ve earned it.”

 

As they laid down, they naturally shifted so that Susato was on top; she was more than comfortable there, although looking at Rei from above set her heart racing. Susato’s hat had slid down on her head once she’d changed her position, so she decided to take it off, setting it on the floor by Rei’s futon. Next, she moved to unbutton the collar of her gakuran, but Rei laid a hand over hers.

 

“Ah, wait...Susato? This is a weird favor to ask, but...it’d be nice if you maybe left the uniform on for a bit,” Rei said. She brought her sleeve up to her face again. It was cute how she tried to hide herself even in a situation like that. "I'll never see Ryutaro again, so just this once..."

 

It seemed like Rei's infatuation with Ryutaro hadn't quite ended yet. Susato was happy to indulge her, however... "Only if you call me Susato, still. I've always loved the way you say my name."

 

Susato hadn't meant for that to sound so perverted (or maybe she had, and didn't realize it), and they both became embarrassed. Susato sought to hide her face, so she kissed Rei again. Rei’s yukata had slipped down her shoulder as she laid down on the futon, but Susato blindly found the fabric with her fingers and slid it down further. Susato moved to kiss the newly-exposed skin, and Rei made a strangled sound. Susato wanted to hear it again, so she kissed lower, until her lips met fabric again.

 

Before she could open the yukata any further, Rei said, “You can take the whole thing off, Susato.”

 

Susato swallowed nervously, but did as Rei had permitted—or, asked for, in a more subtle way. She undid the bow on the yukata, and Rei wriggled out of the fabric. The longing eye contact that remained between them spurred Susato on, so she set to removing Rei’s underwear. Rei was even more cooperative on that front, and her underwear was on the floor in a matter of seconds. Susato couldn’t stop her eyes from wandering, until they fell to the part in Rei’s legs. Her hand followed her eyes, wondering just how warm it was. In a gesture so lewd that Susato’s breath caught in her chest, Rei spread her legs, still looking up at Susato with a pleading expression.

 

That image would be printed in Susato’s mind forever, surely.

 

The only thing that might have come close to it was the face Rei made when Susato’s fingers finally began to touch her. Susato was stroking slowly, experimentally, still trying to figure everything out, but Rei reacted with a hearty moan. Susato was almost in awe at how easy it was; she’d hardly done anything, and yet Rei was making sounds like that? It was like magic.

 

Susato continued to explore, to map out Rei’s womanhood with her fingers. It was almost hard to keep her focus when Rei was making such lovely sounds, but Susato kept at it, her middle and ring finger tracing the perimeter of Rei’s slit with care. Rei started to move her hips in an almost imperceptible way, but Susato quickly picked up on the movement and interpreted it: Rei wanted more. At first, Susato couldn’t figure out what “more” entailed. What more could she do? She wasn’t well-versed in matters of the flesh, especially between two women, and Rei surely wasn’t, either. But the rolling of Rei’s hips, drawing her entrance closer to Susato’s fingertips, gave Susato quite the idea.

 

It was very easy for her fingers to press past the resistance of Rei’s walls, especially when Rei was still rutting into her hand. Rei cried out, and Susato gasped, in reaction to both the carnal sounds Rei was making and the feeling of her slender fingers being almost...sucked in. It was warmer and wetter inside than it was outside. Susato couldn’t help but wonder what it would feel like, if she had that thing, and were to put it inside of Rei...what sort of sounds would Rei make then? And how good would it feel?

 

Susato didn’t let her fantasies take her too far away. Rei was the one to bring her back to Earth, quite literally; Rei reached for Susato’s forearms, then her upper arm, then her shoulder, before pulling her down. Susato felt quite over-dressed, and she longed to feel her skin against Rei’s in a way that she never had before, but she would abide by her wishes for the moment and keep the uniform on. After all, what she wanted above all was to make Rei feel good, to relieve some of the stress that had been accumulated that day.

 

Funny how it was just as relaxing for Susato, to watch Rei come undone beneath her.

 

“How is it, Rei? Good?”

 

“Y-yes...it’s more sensitive than I thought it was,” Rei said, with a hint of a giggle at her lips. It seemed like most of her breath was spent panting and moaning, though. 

 

It was more sensitive than Susato had expected, too. She wanted to find out just how much of Rei’s body was that sensitive. As she dragged her fingers through Rei’s heat, moving in and out of her with great care, her lips moved further down; she remembered how wonderfully Rei had reacted to her kisses earlier. Unlike earlier, though, Rei’s breasts were out in the open, ready for Susato to touch.

 

Abandoning all decorum, Susato lowered her lips to Rei’s nipple, pressed her tongue against it. Rei’s hand tugged at the mound of hair gathered at Susato’s lower neck, but didn’t pull her away. The embarrassment only set in once she started to suckle, feeling much like a hungry babe. The sensation was surely different, though, both for her and for Rei. Rei felt even softer and even warmer when wrapped between her lips, and her reactions made it clear that she liked Susato’s mouth quite a lot.

 

Her voice, although growing in volume, wasn’t the only sign. She was pulling Susato closer to her, holding her there. The hand on Susato’s shoulder almost felt a little painful, even through the fabric of the gakuran, but she couldn’t find it in her to complain—instead, she simply threw herself into her work as always, suckling on Rei’s breast even faster and becoming less reserved with the thrust of her fingers.

 

As Rei’s slick gathered on her fingers, sliding down her palm, Susato came to notice that she could certainly fit another finger if she wanted to stretch Rei even wider. Deciding to be bold, Susato didn’t ask for permission, bending the knuckle of her pointer finger to bring it to Rei’s entrance. Rei must have felt it; she quickly said, “Please, Susato...”

 

Susato lifted her head so she could look into Rei’s eyes, then kissed her along her jawline. They had always been close, but this sort of intimacy was new, and so sweet. Rei exposing herself that way, her body and her erotic voice, was such a privilege for Susato. Feeling Rei’s body wrapped around her fingers was so special, so unforgettable. Susato hadn’t meant to stare, but she couldn’t help it. It was adorable, how Rei simply closed her eyes and turned away, without having sleeves to hide behind.

 

“Show me your face, won’t you, Rei?”

 

She somehow seemed even more beautiful when she turned back. A thin film of sweat had formed over her face, and the rest of her body, too.  Feeling the strangest urge to taste her skin, Susato kissed Rei’s neck; once she detected the faint taste of salt, she felt compelled to suck there.

 

Susato suddenly noticed the way Rei’s body was tensing up. That only prompted her to suckle harder at Rei’s skin, making a mark that would hopefully be covered up by Rei’s yukata—Susato couldn’t give it much thought, at the moment. She felt Rei writhing beneath her, becoming more desperate and nonsensical with her moans. Susato moved her fingers faster, trying to match the frantic pace of Rei’s breaths. Rei’s voice became less audible, silenced by sharp gasps. Susato may have heard a haphazard iteration of her name, but she wasn’t quite sure; her own heart was pounding in her ears as her mind tried to drink in every detail of Rei while she tensed, tensed, tensed, and eventually went slack against her futon.

 

Admittedly, Susato couldn’t tell when it was supposed to be over. Even when Rei loosened her grip on Susato, when her breaths started to slow, Susato kept going, until Rei gave her a weak squeeze on her shoulders.

 

“U-um, Susato...”

 

“Oh! Y-yes?”

 

“That was really good, but...I’m a little...over-sensitive down there, now.”

 

“Ah, yes, of course! Sorry, Rei.” So much for being a perfect gentleman. 

 

Susato couldn’t help but shudder when she pulled her fingers out of Rei, hearing how wet she’d gotten. Susato only noticed how aroused she was herself once Rei was settled against her futon, looking just as ravishing as she had when they’d started. What would Rei’s hands, twice as dexterous and perhaps twice as soft, feel like between Susato’s legs? Or, maybe Susato could quickly get herself off with a hand in her pants...oh, but that would be too vulgar, wouldn’t it, to touch herself while looking at Rei’s naked body...

 

Well, they’d confessed to one another, hadn’t they? So, if Susato was lucky enough, she’d have plenty of chances to touch Rei again, to be touched. For right then, Rei looked quite worn out...which was understandable, considering the day’s events. 

 

Susato took a handkerchief out of her pocket and hastily wiped her fingers off before picking up the folded blankets at the foot of Rei’s futon. The uniform she was wearing wasn’t all that comfortable to lay down in, really, but feeling the warmth of Rei’s body through the fabric was enough for her to settle in easily. They’d never cuddled so closely before, and yet Rei easily slotted herself into Susato’s arms in a way that was cozy for both of them. “I hope Mikotoba-sensei won’t be worried,” Rei mumbled. Susato could hear the sleepiness in her voice.

 

“It’ll be alright, I’m sure. I’ll think of something to tell him,” Susato said. She hadn’t noticed how much she was smiling until then. “I’m happy I stayed. And I’m happy you told me your feelings, too.”

 

“Mm...me too, Susato...”

 

Susato looked down at Rei, and saw that her eyes were already drifting shut. Rei looked at the lamp that had been lit; it would go out on its own, soon, thankfully. Susato would’ve felt like quite the devil had she disturbed Rei’s rest to get up and put it out. That day’s trial was a close call, full of ups and downs for the both of them. As horrible as it was, though, Susato was glad it had led to an outcome like this.

 

I can’t wait to greet the morning with you, Rei...and many more after that.
