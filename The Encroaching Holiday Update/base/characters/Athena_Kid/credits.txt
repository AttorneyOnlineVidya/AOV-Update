As Blackquill would soon learn, the prison guards made their rounds to the lower cell blocks every half hour. As days bled into weeks, into months, this would come to be his only way to tell the time. He didn’t appreciate it then, but he would.

               He did not speak. Not for the first week. He sat, legs crossed and back straight, eyes on the bars ahead, as if they were going to slip away at any moment and grave him liberty.

               He did not speak, until the hundredth or so security round of his incarceration. It was a group of three guards, who passed by his cell without looking at him, looking for him. He may as well already be dead.

               “When,” His voice scraped against his throat, hoarse from disuse. “When is the funeral?”

               His question was met with brackish laughter.

               “Yesterday.” Barked one of the stout guards, leaning forward with his thumbs hooked through his belt loops, podgy face splint into a sneer. The surrounding men continued to chortle as they made their way out of the cell block, leaving him to the darkness.

               Blackquill felt his hands curl into fists, his fingernails bite into his palms. He did not realize there were tears in his eyes.

               They were right to laugh.

               Did you really think they would allow you to attend the funeral of the woman you killed?
 If Blackquill had gone to the funeral, he may have wished he hadn’t.

               The sun did not dare to peek through the overcast grog of the morning, even the birds had kept their cheerful tweeting well below its usual sunrise peak.

               The amount of mourners had been respectable enough. The Space Center had a sizeable staff, and Metis’ research had gained somewhat of a following over the years. Fellow scientists, exchanging their white lab coats for black ones, made up a majority of the attendance. It seemed they were there to mourn the loss of a great mind, more than the woman who owned it.

               The true grief was reserved for the front of the crowd, where two people stood, a girl and the shell of one, who watched the coffin of a mentor, a lover, and a mother, a friend, being lowered into the dirt.

               The young Athena Cykes, fresh out of tears and more lost than anything, risked a glance upwards to the woman beside her. Aura Blackquill stood, looking more like stone than a grave, with a face that couldn’t be read, but a heart that sobbed louder than words could speak. Swallowing the lump in her throat, Athena reached for the woman’s hand, only to receive a stinging slap to her knuckles. “Don’t you dare touch me.” Aura hissed, shoving her hands deep into the pockets of her charcoal trench coat. “Don’t you ever touch me.”    

               Athena shrunk away from her, slipping her own hands into her pockets, amongst bundles of tissues. She looked around her for Blackquill, until she remembered, again, that he wouldn’t be there. The echo of his heart’s screams still played in her ears, now abandoned by her headphones, and the sound was enough to steal away her sleep. Standing there, on the precipice of an abyss staring back of her, that her eyes felt heavy, yet her hands light, unable to hold or help the most important person in her life, now that her mother was gone.

A brief reception was held at the Space Center.

               Researchers mingled, and Athena managed to slip away quite easily. Her absence was not noted. Noticed, by Aura, who was more pleased than anything to comment on it.

               The next morning, Director Cosmos and Solomon Starbuck drove Athena to the airport. An aunt on her father’s side had agreed to take her in. Athena had never met her aunt, just as she had never met the woman’s brother. Her father’s side of the family had always seemed more distant than the stars, yet in a couple hours they would be set for collision. She would be leaving for Europe, which, to a sheltered eleven-year old, may as well have been another planet.

               The ride was silent, Yuri assuming the role of driver as seriously as if he were piloting a spaceship, while Starbuck dozed in the passenger seat as the sunrise bled onto his flaming hair. He had been prescribed new anxiety pills, which tended to make him rather drowsy.

               In the backseat, Athena held her boarding pass in both hands, fighting not to crumple it.

               She had to put her headphones back on once they entered the airport. Too many hearts were shouting with the joy of reunion or the sorrow of departure, and it made her dizzy. She could barely stand straight when they had to be removed while she passed through security. That vertigo stayed with her as she boarded the plane and scooted into the aisle to take her seat by the window. A woman took a seat beside her soon after, gifting Athena with a kind smile. That’s why she decided to risk it.

               There was a word used in Blackquill’s trial that Athena did not understand. Actually, there were a lot of words she didn’t understand, but this one in particular kept a hold on her thoughts, along with the memory of when the word was spoken, and Blackquill, who had remained as stiff as a pole throughout the entirety of the trial, slumped over the witness stand as if he’d gone unconscious. It was right after they had pronounced him guilty, and right before Athena was forcibly removed from the courtroom, screaming.

               “Excuse me, could I ask you a question?” She asked the woman, who smiled again and nodded, charmed by Athena’s seemingly infantile curiosity.

               “What is capital punishment?”

7 years later.
Not guilty. The key to a seven year pair of chains, the reveal of the Phantom, the intensity mingled with ecstasy and horror, all in one swirled around the room, climaxing as the judge’s gavel struck, reverberating.

               The courthouse lobby was a buzz of activity. While arrangements on how to celebrate were being made, Simon took Taka to a nearby window and cast it open, telling the bird she may fly wherever she wished. The sky belonged to them that night. Following the hawk’s victory screech, Simon latched the window shut and turned to be met with Athena, who threw her arms around Simon’s neck, a bell-like laughter pouring from her lips, the warmth of it hitting his neck. “So, what’s the first thing you want to do as a free man?” She asked, drawing back, giggling at the lapse of stoicism that graced his features, a genuine peace, a sort of enchantment, like this were all a dream he didn’t mind being tricked by. The feeling would be nice while it lasted, and Athena was more than determined to make it last.

               “I want to see Metis.”

               Athena’s smile faltered a bit before she regained her footing. She nodded in understanding, dismissing the thought that he’d first want to get a real meal or catch up on missed seasons of The Steel Samurai. Promising Apollo and Mr. Wright that she’d catch back up with them later at Eldoon’s, she and Simon made a discreet exit through the back doors of the courthouse, aiming to avoid the swarm of reporters who wanted the final word on the impromptu trial.

               Following a darting escape, they made their way to the cemetery a few blocks away from the courthouse. Normally, Athena wouldn’t imagine walking the distance so late at night, but with Simon beside her, any fear would be out of place.

               Their footsteps had fallen into place by the time they reached the cemetery entrance, a rusting, wrought-iron gate. The grounds were heavily shaded by large cypress trees that seemed to go on for at least another mile into the distance.

               “When was the last time you visited?” Simon inquired, securing the gate’s latch behind them.

               “It’s been a while, actually.” Athena admitted with a sigh. “Coming back from Europe, I tried to be here at least once a week, but with the craziness of the past few weeks, I was either at the office or the courthouse. No time for personal calls. You’re no easy opponent, you know. You took away all my free time.” She smirked, casting a glance over her shoulder, were he lingered like a warm shadow.

               “As did you.” He replied smoothly. Her grin wavered, thinking for a moment his words were a jab at the years he spent incarcerated at her expense, but the voice of his heart told her that he was just playing along with her banter.

               “It’s this way.” Without thinking, she grabbed his hand, leading him off the gravel walkway to a path in between headstones. She meant to withdraw and stutter some sort of apology, but before she had the chance his fingers folded over hers in wordless reassurance. She hoped there wasn’t enough

               The two walked in silence for a few moments more, Athena fiddling with her earring using her free hand. “So yeah, it’s been a while. Demands of the job, I guess. That, and I was afraid of running into Aura.” She halted for a moment, clapping her hand over her mouth. “I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry.”

               “Do not apologize, Cykes-dono.” He replied, giving her hand a light squeeze. “The woman took your boss’ daughter hostage. She should be the one apologizing.”

               “Do you think she would have done it? K-killed a hostage, I mean.” Athena whispered, her voice wavering, as if she weren’t sure she wanted to hear the answer. Simon slowed, considering the matter with equal unease.

               “I think, if she told herself it was for Metis, she would do anything.”

               They had come to a stop, and Simon realized it was because they had reached their destination.

               The white marble of Metis Cykes’ headstone shone like a star against the surrounding grass, which even in the dark he could tell was well maintained. A small bundle of roses, fresh enough to be from the morning, lay at the base of the stone. Aura’s doing, he presumed.

               “Hi, Mom.” Athena whispered again, as if she were worried she’d wake the dead. “I brought someone with me this time. I’m sure you to have some catching up to do.” She gave Simon an encouraging smile, ushering him forward. “Go on. She’s listening.”

               Simon kneeled in the grass, laying one hand flat against the marble stone. His eyes fell closed, and Athena took a step back, not wanting to intrude on the atmosphere of intimacy that surrounded the reunion on pupil and teacher. He murmured low, that even Athena’s sensitive ears couldn’t pick up his words, aside from “I swear to you.” Which he intoned with emotion threatening to boil over. His heart spoke for him, however, as Athena sensed the reverence he held for Metis, the ache of seven years passed that hurt nearly too much for her to listen to. She refrained from clamping her hands over her ears, she owed it to him, after all, to feel the pain he bore for herself alone.

               Minutes passed in twilight before he rose to his feet, took her hand this time, and led them back up the pathway. No doubt he had imprinted the walk to his memory for future returns.

               They had reached the front gate when Athena looked down at their joined hands, to his steely eyes that did not seem to notice her penetrating gaze, and at their hands again.

               “Simon, what am I to you”?

               The question itself was akin to feeling the barrel of a gun pressed to your neck from behind.

               He felt protective of her, of course, she knew that already. He had told her as much in the courthouse.

               “You are an invaluable part of this world, and a great asset to the legal system. It is an honor to face you in court.” Any other night, the compliment would suffice for everything. But her skills as a lawyer had already been proven to him, she needed to know what he saw aside from that. She shook her head.

               “Do you still see me as some eleven-year old girl?” Her voice was as small as she was then.

He remembered that vividly. With her clunky headphones and bruised eyelids, he couldn’t deny that he had felt intrinsically moved to help her since their first meeting. She had a power that accosted the weight of the world on her shoulders, and he felt called to lift that weight for her. That feeling had never left, that devotedness to her. That had never changed. Yet, she had changed.

She was positive though she was not ignorant. She knew of all the horror of the world and for herself, she chose to remain smiling. He respected that. As someone who only let himself laugh to allude to mockery, he respected that.

Since she was a child, her eyes had brightened with intelligence, her step had lightened to the confidence of a woman on a mission … and her body had adapted to form of one who jogged every morning and knew what yoga poses would pull out her curves. What was she to him? He wasn’t her brother. He wasn’t her babysitter. He wasn’t her boyfriend, yet there had been times when he felt like all three.

For Metis, he would be her shield, the protector of his mentor’s most valuable treasure. Now, how exactly did one put that into words?

He cleared his throat. “I … do not know what you are to me, Cykes-dono. I’m sorry.”

She shook her head slowly, dismissing the apology. There was an emotion in her eyes he couldn’t place, a heavy lidded haziness he’d never seen before. He thought, in that moment, that he would spend another years in prison to know what her heart was saying in that moment. Their gazes remained locked, unbreaking, even after she’d spoken the words he knew would never leave him.

“Would you like to find out?”
